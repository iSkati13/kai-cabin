# 🔒 Firebase Security Action Plan for Kai's Cabin

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Step 1: Configure HTTP Referrer Restrictions (CRITICAL)

**Go to Firebase Console:**
1. Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/kais-cabin-admin/settings/general
2. Click on your web app (should be named something like "kais-cabin-admin")
3. Scroll down to "Authorized domains"
4. Add these domains:
   - `kaiscabin.com`
   - `www.kaiscabin.com`
   - `localhost` (for development)
   - `127.0.0.1` (for development)

**Why this is critical:** This ensures your API key only works from your authorized domains.

### Step 2: Deploy Firestore Security Rules

**Option A: Using the provided script**
```bash
./deploy-security-rules.sh
```

**Option B: Manual deployment**
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Step 3: Test the Security Setup

1. **Test booking form** - Ensure it still works
2. **Test rate limiting** - Try submitting multiple reservations quickly
3. **Test unauthorized access** - Try accessing from unauthorized domains

## 🔄 OPTIONAL: Regenerate API Key

**If you want to be extra cautious:**

1. Go to Firebase Console > Project Settings > General
2. Find your web app configuration
3. Click "Regenerate" next to the API key
4. Update `js/firebase-config.js` with the new key
5. Deploy the updated website

**Note:** This is optional since the current key is already properly restricted.

2. Set up alerts for:
   - Unusual read/write activity
   - High usage spikes
   - Failed authentication attempts

### Regular Security Reviews:
- Monthly: Check Firebase logs for unusual activity

## 📞 Emergency Procedures

**If you suspect a security breach:**

1. **Immediate (5 minutes):**
   - Regenerate API key in Firebase Console
   - Update `js/firebase-config.js`
   - Deploy updated website

2. **Investigation (1 hour):**
   - Check Firebase logs for unusual activity
   - Review recent reservations for suspicious patterns
   - Verify security rules are still active
